# Instructions for IT Admin

You're here because a colleague asked you to set up Soda for them. Great!<br />
Here is what you need:
* Connection configuration details for the data source in your organization that contains the data your colleague wants to test for data quality. 
* A new or existing Kubernetes cluster in which you can deploy a containerized Soda Agent application.
* A Soda Cloud account, which you can create via an emailed invitation from your colleague.
